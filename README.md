# RideShare
CS 581 Project on Ride Sharing using New York City taxi data. 

Ride sharing is a service that helps taxi users to pool their single shared ride between fixed starting point and different destinations. In today’s world, we see lot of congestion in the road network due to vehicular traffic. The traffic congestion increases the average commutation time to all passengers and indirectly the cost to travel. We believe Ride sharing can provide a way to tackle this problem by pooling people going to similar destinations from a fixed starting point such as Airport, Metro Station, and Office etc. and in turn reduce the number of vehicles on road. The ride-sharing algorithm estimates dual benefits i.e. low rates for the taxi users’ and increased fuel efficiency for the driver without compromising on the overall profit.

In this CS 581 course project work, we device a ride sharing algorithm for New York City. We consider three hot spots where we believe the need for ridesharing is high. The report briefs about the data analysis, algorithm approach and the experimental results. We further analyze the results obtained to ensure that the algorithm developed meets the constraints set for an ideal ride-sharing network. Finally, we compare the results obtained against the existing baseline single trips on various pre-defined parameters.

We evaluate the results based on how multiple requests from users are pooled successfully.The report describes the dataset used for the project and explains how the data was broken into simpler subset for the purpose of experiment. The algorithm divides the data into three different time-period namely - peak hours, normal hours and non-peak hours to consider various factors. We provide an estimate on how the algorithm would evaluate the routes in real time, using the algorithm derived from historical data.
